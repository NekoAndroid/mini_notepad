# mini_notepad
Tiny, no fuss CLI notepad written in C

## What is this?
It's a lightweight app designed to run on very, very constrainted environments, using just above 66KiB of RAM, and to
not be as distractive as possible

## Commands:
All commands follow the same pattern: </[COMMAND]>, with [COMMAND]
being either of these below: (the commands are lowercase sensitive btw)

save: Saves the file to the file name (or path) you wish (Doesn't save the command though, it's removed from the file)

load: Loads a file (WARNING: No alterations are saved if you used this command! Be careful with it!)

exit: Exits the program (self-explanatory)
